angular-seed-visualforce
====

This project is an attempt to recreate the skeleton of the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) repo, but leveraging Visualforce design paradigms to accomplish it.

To take advantage of the resource-bundle folder, take a look at [MavensMate](https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate) which has automated Resource Bundle deployments.

Notes
----

* The /app/partials folder is now implemented as Visualforce pages
